    <p>
      This page presents selected academic and engineering projects focused on
      energy systems, thermo-fluid processes, and data-driven analysis. The projects
      span techno-economic modeling, system design, and experimental prototyping.

      -->

      <p>
        Conducted a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a rural micro-energy
        system, focusing on optimal sizing and cost modeling of distributed energy
        assets. The study evaluated system configurations based on performance,
        capital cost, operating expenses, and long-term sustainability metrics.
      </p>

      <p>
        The analysis supported decision-making for community-scale energy planning
        and informed design trade-offs between reliability, affordability, and
        resource availability.

      <p>
        Designed a pyrolytic system for liquid smoke production, including the
        selection of process parameters, thermal operating conditions, and overall
        system layout. The project emphasized process efficiency, controllability,
        and product quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        System design considerations included feedstock handling, temperature
        regulation, vapor condensation, and operational safety.

      <p>
        Developed a metallic Tier-3 biomass cookstove designed for both cooking and
        space heating applications. The design prioritized thermal efficiency,
        emissions reduction, and durability.
      </p>

      <p>
        In parallel, performed analytical evaluation of a ground-source heat pump
        system to assess feasibility and performance for residential heating
        applications.
