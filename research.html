    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>
      My research focuses on the development and application of scientific machine
      learning methods for the modeling, analysis, and interpretation of engineering
      and physical systems. I am particularly interested in combining physics-based
      understanding with data-driven approaches to improve predictive reliability
      and interpretability.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work spans computational modeling, energy systems analysis, and experimental
      system design, with an emphasis on using data-informed methods to support
      engineering decision-making.
    </p>

      <h3>Scientific Machine Learning for Physical Systems</h3>

      <p>
        A central theme of my research is the use of scientific machine learning
        techniques to model complex physical and engineering systems. This includes
        integrating physical constraints, conservation laws, and domain knowledge
        into machine learning frameworks to enhance model generalization and
        interpretability.
      </p>

      <p>
        I focus on simulation-driven datasets, feature engineering, and the
        development of scalable computational workflows that bridge classical
        modeling approaches with modern learning architectures.
      </p>

      <h3>Energy Systems Modeling and Techno-Economic Analysis</h3>

      <p>
        I have conducted research on the modeling and techno-economic evaluation
        of energy systems, with particular attention to rural and community-scale
        applications. This work involves system sizing, cost modeling, and
        performance assessment of distributed energy assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this research is to support informed design decisions that
        balance technical performance, economic feasibility, and long-term
        sustainability.
      </p>

      <h3>Thermal and Thermochemical Systems</h3>

      <p>
        My research experience also includes the design and analysis of thermal
        and thermochemical systems, such as biomass-based energy conversion
        technologies and heating systems. This work combines analytical modeling
        with experimental design and performance evaluation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples include pyrolytic system design, advanced biomass cookstoves,
        and feasibility analysis of ground-source heat pump systems.

      <h3>Integration of Data, Models, and Experiments</h3>

      <p>
        Across all projects, I aim to integrate data-driven analysis with
        physics-based models and experimental insights. My research philosophy
        emphasizes reproducibility, interpretability, and the translation of
        computational results into practical engineering understanding.
